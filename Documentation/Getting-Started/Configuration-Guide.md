# MariaDB MaxScale Configuration Guide

[TOC]

# Introduction

This document describes how to configure MariaDB MaxScale and presents some
possible usage scenarios. MariaDB MaxScale is designed with flexibility in mind,
and consists of an event processing core with various support functions and
plugin modules that tailor the behavior of the program.

# Concepts

## Glossary

Word | Description
--------------------|----------------------------------------------------
connection routing  | Connection routing is a method of handling requests in which MariaDB MaxScale will accept connections from a client and route data on that connection to a single database using a single connection. Connection based routing will not examine individual requests on a connection and it will not move that connection once it is established.
statement routing   | Statement routing is a method of handling requests in which each request within a connection will be handled individually. Requests may be sent to one or more servers and connections may be dynamically added or removed from the session.
module              | A module is a separate code entity that may be loaded dynamically into MariaDB MaxScale to increase the available functionality. Modules are implemented as run-time loadable shared objects.
connection failover | When a connection currently being used between MariaDB MaxScale and the database server fails a replacement will be automatically created to another server by MariaDB MaxScale without client intervention
backend database    | A term used to refer to a database that sits behind MariaDB MaxScale and is accessed by applications via MariaDB MaxScale.
REST API | HTTP administrative interface

## Objects

### Server

A server represents an individual database server to which a client can be
connected via MariaDB MaxScale. The status of a server varies during the lifetime
of the server and typically the status is updated by some monitor. However, it
is also possible to update the status of a server manually.

Status | Description
-------|------------
Running       | The server is running.
Master        | The server is the master.
Slave         | The server is a slave.
Draining      | The server is being drained. Existing connections can continue to be used, but no new connections will be created to the server. Typically this status bit is turned on manually using _maxctrl_, but a monitor may also turn it on.
Drained       | The server has been drained. The server was being drained and now the number of connections to the server has dropped to 0.
Auth Error    | The monitor cannot login and query the server due to insufficient privileges.
Maintenance   | The server is under maintenance. Typically this status bit is turned on manually using _maxctrl_, but it will also be turned on for a server that for some reason is blocking connections from MaxScale. When a server is in maintenace mode, no connections will be created to it and existing connections will be closed.
Slave of External Master | The server is a slave of a master that is not being monitored.

For more information on how to manually set these states via MaxCtrl, read the
[Administration Tutorial](../Tutorials/Administration-Tutorial.md).

### Monitor

A monitor module is capable of monitoring the state of a particular kind
of cluster and making that state available to the routers of MaxScale.

Examples of monitor modules are `mariadbmon` that is capable of monitoring
a regular master-slave cluster and in addition of performing both _switchover_
and _failover_, `galeramon` that is capable of monitoring a Galera cluster,
`csmon` that is capable of monitoring a Columnstore cluster and `xpandmon`
that is capable of monitoring a Xpand cluster.

Monitor modules have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration
file.

### Filter

A filter module resides in front of routers in the request processing chain
of MaxScale. That is, a filter will see a request before it reaches the router
and before a response is sent back to the client. This allows filters to
reject, handle, alter or log information about a request.

Examples of filters are `dbfwfilter` that is a configurable firewall, `cache`
that provides query caching according to rules, `regexfilter` that can rewrite
requests according to regular expressions, and `qlafilter` that logs
information about requests.

Filters have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration file that are
referred to from _services_.

### Router

A router module is capable of routing requests to backend servers according to
the characteristics of a request and/or the algorithm the router
implements. Examples of routers are `readconnroute` that provides _connection
routing_, that is, the server is chosen according to specified rules when the
session is created and all requests are subsequently routed to that server,
and `readwritesplit` that provides _statement routing_, that is, each
individual request is routed to the most appropriate server.

Routers do not have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration file,
but are referred to from _services_.

### Service

A service abstracts a set of databases and makes them appear as a single one
to the client. Depending on what router (e.g. `readconnroute` or
`readwritesplit`) the service uses, the servers are used in some particular
way. If the service uses filters, then all requests will be pre-processed in
some way before they reach the router.

Services have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration file.

### Listener

A listener defines a port MaxScale listens on. Connection requests arriving on
that port will be forwarded to the service the listener is associated with. A
listener may be associated with a single service, but several listeners may be
associated with the same service.

Listeners have sections of their own in the MaxScale configuration file.

# Administration

The administation of MaxScale can be divided in two parts:

* Writing the MaxScale configuration file, which is described in the following
  [section](#configuration).
* Performing runtime modifications using [MaxCtrl](../Reference/MaxCtrl.md)

For detailed information about _MaxCtrl_ please refer to the specific
documentation referred to above. In the following it will only be explained how
MaxCtrl relate to each other, as far as user credentials go.

MaxCtrl can connect using TCP/IP sockets. When connecting with MaxCtrl using
TCP/IP sockets, the user and password must be provided and are checked against a
separate user credentials database. By default, that database contains the user
`admin` whose password is `mariadb`.

Note that if MaxCtrl is invoked without explicitly providing a user and password
then it will by default use `admin` and `mariadb`. That means that when the
default user is removed, the credentials must always be provded.

## Static Configuration Parameters

The following list of global configuration parameters can **NOT** be changed at
runtime and can only be defined in a configuration file:

* `admin_auth`
* `admin_enabled`
* `admin_gui`
* `admin_host`
* `admin_pam_readonly_service`
* `admin_pam_readwrite_service`
* `admin_port`
* `admin_secure_gui`
* `admin_ssl_ca_cert`
* `admin_ssl_cert`
* `admin_ssl_key`
* `admin_ssl_version`
* `cachedir`
* `connector_plugindir`
* `datadir`
* `debug`
* `debug`
* `execdir`
* `language`
* `libdir`
* `load_persisted_configs`
* `local_address`
* `log_augmentation`
* `log_warn_super_user`
* `logdir`
* `module_configdir`
* `persistdir`
* `piddir`
* `query_classifier_args`
* `query_classifier`
* `query_retries`
* `sql_mode`
* `sharedir`
* `substitute_variables`
* `threads`

All other parameters that relate to objects can be altered at runtime or can be
changed by destroying and recreating the object in question.

# Configuration

The MariaDB MaxScale configuration is read from a file that MariaDB MaxScale
will look for in the following places:

1. By default, the file `maxscale.cnf` in the directory `/etc`
2. The location given with the `--configdir=<path>` command line argument.

MariaDB MaxScale will further look for a directory with the same name as the
configuration file, followed by `.d` (for instance `/etc/maxscale.cnf.d`) and
recursively read all files, having a `.cnf` suffix, it finds in the directory
hierarchy. All other files will be ignored.

There are no restrictions on how different configuration sections are arranged,
but the strong suggestion is to place global settings into the configuration
file MariaDB MaxScale is invoked with, and then, if deemed necessary, create
separate configuration files for _servers_, _filters_, etc.

The configuration file itself is based on the
[.ini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) file format and consists of
various sections that are used to build the configuration; these sections define
services, servers, listeners, monitors and global settings.

Comments are defined by prefixing a row with a hash (`#`). Trailing comments are
not supported.

```
# This is a comment before a parameter
some_parameter=123
```

**Note:** Multi-line parameters have been deprecated in MaxScale 6.0 due to
  the unintuitive way they worked when the same parameter was declared multiple
  times.

Parameters, which expect a comma-separated list of values can be defined on
multiple lines. The following is an example of a multi-line definition.

```
[MyService]
type=service
router=readconnroute
servers=server1,
        server2,
        server3
```

The values of the parameter that are not on the first line need to have at least
one whitespace character before them in order for them to be recognized as a
part of the multi-line parameter.

## Names

Section names may not contain whitespace and must not start with the characters
`@@`, but otherwise there are no restrictions.

As the object names are used to form URLs in the MaxScale REST API, they must be
safe for use in URLs. This means that only alphanumeric characters (i.e. `a-z`
`A-Z` and `0-9`) and the special characters `_.~-` can be used.

## Dynamic Parameters

If a parameter is described to be dynamic, it can be modified at runtime via
MaxCtrl or the REST API. If the parameter is not dynamic (i.e. static), it can
only be defined at startup via the MaxScale configuration file.

## Special Parameter Types

### Booleans

Boolean type parameters interpret the values `true`, `yes`, `on` and `1` as
_true_ values and `false`, `no`, `off` and `0` as _false_ values. The REST API
only accepts JSON boolean values for boolean type parameters.

### Sizes

Where _specifically noted_, a number denoting a size can be suffixed by a subset
of the IEC binary prefixes or the SI prefixes. In the former case the number
will be interpreted as a certain multiple of 1024 and in the latter case as a
certain multiple of 1000. The supported IEC binary suffixes are `Ki`, `Mi`, `Gi`
and `Ti` and the supported SI suffixes are `k`, `M`, `G` and `T`. In both cases,
the matching is case insensitive.

For instance, the following entries
```
max_size=1099511628000
max_size=1073741824Ki
max_size=1048576Mi
max_size=1024Gi
max_size=1Ti
```
are equivalent, as are the following
```
max_size=1000000000000
max_size=1000000000k
max_size=1000000M
max_size=1000G
max_size=1T
```

### Durations

A number denoting a duration can be suffixed by one of the case-insensitive
suffixes `h`, `m` or `min`, `s` and `ms`, for specifying durations in hours,
minutes, seconds and milliseconds, respectively.

For instance, the following entries
```
soft_ttl=1h
soft_ttl=60m
soft_ttl=60min
soft_ttl=3600s
soft_ttl=3600000ms
```
are equivalent.

Note that if an explicit unit is not specified, then it is specific to the
configuration parameter whether the duration is interpreted as seconds or
milliseconds.

_Not_ providing an explicit unit has been deprecated in MaxScale 2.4.

### Regular Expressions

Many modules have settings which accept a regular expression. In most cases, these
settings are named either *match* or *exclude*, and are used to filter users or queries.
MaxScale uses the [PCRE2-library](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/) for matching
regular expressions.

When writing a regular expression (regex) type parameter to a MaxScale configuration file,
the pattern string should be enclosed in slashes e.g. `^select` -> `match=/^select/`. This
clarifies where the pattern begins and ends, even if it includes whitespace. Without
slashes the configuration loader trims the pattern from the ends. The slashes are removed
before compiling the pattern. For backwards compatibility, the slashes are not yet
mandatory. Omitting them is, however, deprecated and will be rejected in a future release
of MaxScale. Currently, *binlogfilter*, *ccrfilter*, *qlafilter*, *tee* and *avrorouter*
accept parameters in this type of regular expression form. Some other modules may not
handle the slashes yet correctly.

PCRE2 supports a complicated regular expression
[syntax](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html). MaxScale typically uses
regular expressions simply, only checking whether the pattern and subject match at some
point. For example, using the QLAFilter and setting `match=/SELECT/` causes the filter to
accept any query with the text "SELECT" somewhere within. To force the pattern to only
match at the beginning of the query, set `match=/^SELECT/`. To only match the end, set
`match=/SELECT$/`.

Modules which accept regular expression parameters also often accept options which affect
how the patterns are compiled. Typically, this setting is called *options* and accepts
values such as `ignorecase`, `case` and `extended`. `ignorecase` causes the regular
expression matcher to ignore letter case, and is often on by default. `extended` ignores
whitespace in the pattern. `case` turns on case-sensitive matching. These settings can
also be defined in the pattern itself, so they can be used even in modules without
pattern compilation settings. The pattern settings are `(?i)` for `ignorecase` and `(?x)`
for `extended`. See the
[PCRE2 syntax documentation](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html#SEC16)
for more information.

#### Standard regular expression settings for filters

Many filters use the settings *match*, *exclude* and *options*. Since these settings are
used in a similar way across these filters, the settings are explained here. The
documentation of the filters link here and describe any exceptions to this
generalized explanation.

These settings typically limit the queries the filter module acts on. *match* and
*exclude* define PCRE2 regular expression patterns while *options* affects how both of the
patterns are compiled. *options* works as explained above, accepting the values
`ignorecase`, `case` and `extended`, with `ignorecase` being the default.

The queries are matched as they arrive to the filter on their way to a routing module. If
*match* is defined, the filter only acts on queries matching that pattern. If *match* is
not defined, all queries are considered to match.

If *exclude* is defined, the filter only acts on queries not matching that pattern. If
*exclude* is not defined, nothing is excluded.

If both are defined, the query needs to match *match* but not match *exclude*.

Even if a filter does not act on a query, the query is not lost. The query is simply
passed on to the next module in the processing chain as if the filter was not there.

## Global Settings

The global settings, in a section named `[MaxScale]`, allow various parameters
that affect MariaDB MaxScale as a whole to be tuned. This section must be
defined in the root configuration file which by default is `/etc/maxscale.cnf`.

### `threads`

This parameter controls the number of worker threads that are handling the
events coming from the kernel. The default is `auto` which uses as many threads
as there are CPU cores. MaxScale versions older than 6 used one thread by
default.

You can explicitly enable automatic configuration of this value by setting the
value to `auto`. This way MariaDB MaxScale will detect the number of available
processors and set the amount of threads to be equal to that number.

The maximum value for threads is 100.

```
# Valid options are:
#       threads=[<number of threads> | auto ]

[MaxScale]
threads=auto
```

Additional threads will be created to execute other internal services within
MariaDB MaxScale. This setting is used to configure the number of threads that
will be used to manage the user connections.

### `rebalance_period`

This duration parameter controls how often the load of the worker threads
should be checked. The default value is 0, which means that no checks and
no rebalancing will be performed.
```
rebalance_period=10s
```
Note that the value of `rebalance_period` should not be smaller than the
value of `rebalance_window` whose default value is 10.

If the value of `rebalance_period` is significantly shorter than that
of `rebalance_window`, it may lead to oscillation where work is constantly
moved from one thread to another.

### `rebalance_threshold`

This integer parameter controls at which point MaxScale should start
moving work from one worker thread to another.

If the difference in load between the thread with the maximum load and
the thread with the minimum load is larger than the value of this parameter,
then work will be moved from the former to the latter.

Although the load of a thread can vary between 0 and 100, the value of this
parameter must be between 5 and 100. The default value is 20.
```
rebalance_threshold=15
```
Note that rebalancing will not be performed unless `rebalance_period`
has been specified.

### `rebalance_window`

This integer parameter controls how many seconds of load should be
taken into account when deciding whether work should be moved from
one thread to another.

The default value is 10, which means that the load during the last 10
seconds is considered when deciding whether work should be moved.

The minimum value is 1 and the maximum 60.

### `auth_connect_timeout`

Duration, default 10s. This setting defines the connection timeout when
attempting to fetch MariaDB/MySQL/Clustrix users from a backend server. The same
value is also used for read and write timeouts. Increasing this value causes
MaxScale to wait longer for a response from a server before user fetching fails.
Other servers may then be attempted.

```
auth_connect_timeout=10s
```

The value is given as [a duration](#durations). If no explicit unit is provided,
the value is interpreted as seconds. In subsequent versions a value without a
unit may be rejected. Since the granularity of the timeout is seconds, a timeout
specified in milliseconds will be rejected even if the given value is longer
than a second.

### `auth_read_timeout`

Deprecated and ignored as of MaxScale 2.5.0. See *auth_connect_timeout* above.

### `auth_write_timeout`

Deprecated and ignored as of MaxScale 2.5.0. See *auth_connect_timeout* above.

### `query_retries`

The number of times an interrupted internal query will be retried. The default
is to retry the query once. This feature was added in MaxScale 2.1.10 and was
disabled by default until MaxScale 2.3.0.

An interrupted query is any query that is interrupted by a network
error. Connection timeouts are included in network errors and thus is it
advisable to make sure that the value of `query_retry_timeout` is set to an
adequate value. Internal queries are only used to retrieve authentication data
and monitor the servers.

### `query_retry_timeout`

The total timeout in seconds for any retried queries. The default value is 5
seconds.

An interrupted query is retried for either the configured amount of attempts or
until the configured timeout is reached.

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

### `passive`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Controls whether MaxScale is a passive node in a cluster of multiple MaxScale
instances.

This parameter is intended to be used with multiple MaxScale instances that use
failover functionality to manipulate the cluster in some form. Passive nodes
only observe the clusters being monitored and take no direct actions.

The following functionality is disabled when passive mode is enabled:

 * Automatic failover in the `mariadbmon` module
 * Automatic rejoin in the `mariadbmon` module
 * Launching of monitor scripts

**NOTE:** Even if MaxScale is in passive mode, it will still accept clients and
  route any traffic sent to it. The **only** operations affected by the passive
  mode are the ones listed above.

### `ms_timestamp`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Enable or disable the high precision timestamps in logfiles. Enabling this adds
millisecond precision to all logfile timestamps.

### `skip_permission_checks`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Skip service and monitor user permission checks. This is useful when you know
the permissions are OK and you want to speed up the startup process.

It is recommended to not disable the permission checks so that any missing
privileges are detected when maxscale is starting up. If you are experiencing a
slow startup of MaxScale due to large amounts of connection timeouts when
permissions are checked, disabling the permission checks could speed up the
startup process.

```
skip_permission_checks=true
```

### `syslog`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Log messages to *syslog*.

### `maxlog`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Log messages to MariaDB MaxScale's log file.

### `log_warning`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Log messages whose syslog priority is *warning*.

MaxScale logs warning level messages whenever a condition is encountered that
the user should be notified of but does not require immediate action or it
indicates a minor problem.

### `log_notice`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Log messages whose syslog priority is *notice*.

These messages contain information that is helpful for the user and they usually
do not indicate a problem. These are logged whenever something worth nothing
happens in either MaxScale or in the servers it monitors.

### `log_info`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Log messages whose syslog priority is *info*.

These messages provide detailed information about the internal workings of
MariaDB MaxScale. These messages should only be enabled when there is a need to
inspect the internal logic of MaxScale. A common use-case is to see why a
particular query was handled in a certain way. Almost all modules log some
messages on the info level and this can be very helpful when trying to solve
routing related problems.

### `log_debug`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Log messages whose syslog priority is *debug*.

These messages are intended for development purposes and are disabled by
default. These are rarely useful outside of debugging core MaxScale issues.

**Note:** If MariaDB MaxScale has been built in release mode, then debug
messages are excluded from the build and this setting will not have any
effect. If an attempt to enable these is made, a warning is logged.

### `log_warn_super_user`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: No

When enabled, a warning is logged whenever a client with SUPER-privilege
successfully authenticates. This also applies to COM_CHANGE_USER-commands. The
setting is intended for diagnosing situations where a client interferes with a
master server switchover. Super-users bypass the *read_only*-flag which
switchover uses to block writes to the master.

### `log_augmentation`

- **Type**: integer
- **Default**: 0
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Enable or disable the augmentation of messages. If this is enabled, then each
logged message is appended with the name of the function where the message was
logged. This is primarily for development purposes and hence is disabled by
default.

```
# Valid options are:
#       log_augmentation=<0|1>
log_augmentation=1
```

To disable the augmentation use the value 0 and to enable it use the value 1.

### `log_throttling`

It is possible that a particular error (or warning) is logged over and over
again, if the cause for the error persistently remains. To prevent the log from
flooding, it is possible to specify how many times a particular error may be
logged within a time period, before the logging of that error is suppressed for
a while.

```
# A valid value looks like
#       log_throttling = X, Y, Z
#
# where the first value X is a positive integer and means the number of times
# a specific error may be logged within a duration of Y, before the logging
# of that error is suppressed for a duration of Z.
log_throttling=8, 2s, 15000ms
```

In the example above, the logging of a particular error will be suppressed for
15 seconds if the error has been logged 8 times in 2 seconds.

The default is `10, 1000ms, 10000ms`, which means that if the same error is
logged 10 times in one second, the logging of that error is suppressed for the
following 10 seconds.

To disable log throttling, add an entry with an empty value

```
log_throttling=
```
or one where any of the integers is 0.

```
log_throttling=0, 0, 0
```
The durations can be specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit
unit is provided, the value is interpreted as milliseconds in MaxScale 2.4. In
subsequent versions a value without a unit may be rejected.

Note that *notice*, *info* and *debug* messages are never throttled.

### `logdir`

Set the directory where the logfiles are stored. The folder needs to be both
readable and writable by the user running MariaDB MaxScale.

The default value is `/var/log/maxscale/`.

```
logdir=/var/log/maxscale/
```

### `datadir`

Set the directory where the data files used by MariaDB MaxScale are stored.
Modules can write to this directory and for example the binlogrouter uses this
folder as the default location for storing binary logs.

This is also the directory where the password encryption key is read from that
is generated by `maxkeys`.

The default value is `/var/lib/maxscale/`.

```
datadir=/var/lib/maxscale/
```

### `libdir`

Set the directory where MariaDB MaxScale looks for modules. The library
directory is the only directory that MariaDB MaxScale uses when it searches for
modules. If you have custom modules for MariaDB MaxScale, make sure you have
them in this folder.

The default value depends on the operating system. For RHEL versions the value
is `/usr/lib64/maxscale/`. For Debian and Ubuntu it is
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/maxscale/`

```
libdir=/usr/lib64/maxscale/
```

### `sharedir`

Sets the directory where static data assets are loaded.

The MaxScale GUI static files are located in the `gui/` subdirectory. If the GUI
files have been manually moved somewhere else, this path must be configured to
point to the parent directory of the `gui/` subdirectory.

The MaxScale REST API only serves files for the GUI that are located in the
`gui/` subdirectory of the configured `sharedir`. Any files whose real path
resolves to outside of this directory are not served by the MaxScale GUI: this
is done to prevent other files from being accessible via the MaxScale REST
API. This means that path to the GUI source directory can contain symbolic links
but all parts after the `/gui/` directory must reside inside it.

The default value is `/usr/share/maxscale/`.

### `cachedir`

Configure the directory MariaDB MaxScale uses to store cached data.

The default value is `/var/cache/maxscale/`.

```
cachedir=/var/cache/maxscale/
```

### `piddir`

Configure the directory for the PID file for MariaDB MaxScale. This file
contains the Process ID for the running MariaDB MaxScale process.

The default value is `/var/run/maxscale/`.

```
piddir=/var/run/maxscale/
```

### `execdir`

Configure the directory where the executable files reside. All internal
processes which are launched will use this directory to look for executable
files.

The default value is `/usr/bin/`.

```
execdir=/usr/bin/
```

### `connector_plugindir`

Location of the MariaDB Connector-C plugin directory. The MariaDB Connector-C
used in MaxScale can use this directory to load authentication plugins. The
versions of the plugins must be binary compatible with the connector version
that MaxScale was built with.

Starting with version 6.2.0, the plugins are bundled with MaxScale and the
default value now points to the bundled plugins. The location where the plugins
are stored depends on the operating system. For RHEL versions the value is
`/usr/lib64/maxscale/plugin/`. For Debian and Ubuntu it is
`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/maxscale/plugin/`.

Older versions of MaxScale used `/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/` as the default value.

```
connector_plugindir=/usr/lib64/maxscale/plugin/
```

### `persistdir`

Configure the directory where persisted configurations are stored. When a new
object is created via MaxCtrl, it will be stored in this directory. Do not use
or modify the contents of this directory, use _/etc/maxscale.cnf.d/_ instead.

The default value is `/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale.cnf.d/`.

```
persistdir=/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale.cnf.d/
```

### `module_configdir`

Configure the directory where module configurations are stored. Path arguments
are resolved relative to this directory. This directory should be used to store
module specific configurations e.g. dbfwfilter rule files.

Any configuration parameter that is not an absolute path will be interpreted as
a relative path. The relative paths use the module configuration directory as
the working directory.

For example, the configuration parameter `file=my_file.txt` would be interpreted
as `/etc/maxscale.modules.d/my_file.txt` whereas `file=/home/user/my_file.txt` would
be interpreted as `/home/user/my_file.txt`.

The default value is `/etc/maxscale.modules.d/`.

```
module_configdir=/etc/maxscale.modules.d/
```

### `language`

Set the folder where the errmsg.sys file is located in. MariaDB MaxScale will
look for the errmsg.sys file installed with MariaDB MaxScale from this folder.

The default value is `/var/lib/maxscale/`.

```
language=/var/lib/maxscale/
```

### `query_classifier`

The module used by MariaDB MaxScale for query classification. The information
provided by this module is used by MariaDB MaxScale when deciding where a
particular statement should be sent. The default query classifier is
_qc_sqlite_.

### `query_classifier_cache_size`

Specifies the maximum size of the query classifier cache. The default limit is
15% of total system memory starting with MaxScale 2.3.7. In older versions the
default limit was 40% of total system memory. This feature was added in MaxScale
2.3.0.

When the query classifier cache has been enabled, MaxScale will, after a
statement has been parsed, store the classification result using the
canonicalized version of the statement as the key.

If the classification result for a statement is needed, MaxScale will first
canonicalize the statement and check whether the result can be found in the
cache.  If it can, the statement will not be parsed at all but the cached result
is used.

The configuration parameter takes one integer that specifies the maximum size of
the cache. The size of the cache can be specifed as explained [here](#sizes).

```
# 1MB query classifier cache
query_classifier_cache_size=1MB
```

Note that MaxScale uses a separate cache for each worker thread. To obtain the
amount of memory available for each thread, divide the cache size with the value
of `threads`. If statements are evicted from the cache (visible in the
diagnostic output), consider increasing the cache size.

Using `maxctrl show threads` it is possible to check what the actual size of
the cache is and to see performance statistics.

Key|Meaning
---|-------
QC cache size|The current size of the cache (bytes).
QC cache inserts|How many entries have been inserted into the cache.
QC cache hits|How many times the classification result has been found from the cache.
QC cache misses|How many times the classification result has not been found from the cache, but the classification had to be performed.
QC cache evictions|How many times a cache entry has had to be removed from the cache, in order to make place for another.

### `query_classifier_args`

Arguments for the query classifier. What arguments are accepted depends on the
particular query classifier being used. The default query classifier -
_qc_sqlite_ - supports the following arguments:

#### `log_unrecognized_statements`

An integer argument taking the following values:
   * 0: Nothing is logged. This is the default.
   * 1: Statements that cannot be parsed completely are logged. They may have been
partially parsed, or classified based on keyword matching.
   * 2: Statements that cannot even be partially parsed are logged. They may have
been classified based on keyword matching.
   * 3: Statements that cannot even be classified by keyword matching are logged.

```
query_classifier=qc_sqlite
query_classifier_args=log_unrecognized_statements=1
```

This will log all statements that cannot be parsed completely. This may be
useful if you suspect that MariaDB MaxScale routes statements to the wrong
server (e.g. to a slave instead of to a master).

### `substitute_variables`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: No

Enable or disable the substitution of environment variables in the MaxScale
configuration file. If the substitution of variables is enabled and a
configuration line like
```
some_parameter=$SOME_VALUE
```
is encountered, then `$SOME_VALUE` will be replaced with the actual value
of the environment variable `SOME_VALUE`. Note:
* Variable substitution will be made _only_ if '$' is the first character
  of the value.
* _Everything_ following '$' is interpreted as the name of the environment
  variable.
* Referring to a non-existing environment variable is a fatal error.

```
substitute_variables=true
```

The setting of `substitute_variables` will have an effect on all parameters
in the all other sections, irrespective of where the `[maxscale]` section
is placed in the configuration file. However, in the `[maxscale]` section,
to ensure that substitution will take place, place the
`substitute_variables=true` line first.

### `sql_mode`

Specifies whether the query classifier parser should initially expect _MariaDB_
or _PL/SQL_ kind of SQL.

The allowed values are:
   `default`: The parser expects regular _MariaDB_ SQL.
   `oracle` : The parser expects PL/SQL.

```
sql_mode=oracle
```

The default value is `default`.

**NOTE** If `sql_mode` is set to `oracle`, then MaxScale will also assume
that `autocommit` initially is off.

At runtime, MariaDB MaxScale will recognize statements like
```
set sql_mode=oracle;
```
and
```
set sql_mode=default;
```
and change mode accordingly.

**NOTE** If `set sql_mode=oracle;` is encountered, then MaxScale will also
behave as if `autocommit` had been turned off and conversely, if
`set sql_mode=default;` is encountered, then MaxScale will also behave
as if `autocommit` had been turned on.

Note that MariaDB MaxScale is **not** explicitly aware of the sql mode of
the server, so the value of `sql_mode` should reflect the sql mode used
when the server is started.

### `local_address`

What specific local address/interface to use when connecting to servers.

This can be used for ensuring that MaxScale uses a particular interface
when connecting to servers, in case the computer MaxScale is running on
has multiple interfaces.
```
local_address=192.168.1.254
```

### `users_refresh_time`

How often, in seconds, MaxScale at most may refresh the users from the
backend server.

MaxScale will at startup load the users from the backend server, but if
the authentication of a user fails, MaxScale assumes it is because a new
user has been created and will thus refresh the users. By default, MaxScale
will do that at most once per 30 seconds and with this configuration option
that can be changed. A value of 0 allows infinite refreshes and a negative
value disables the refreshing entirely.

```
users_refresh_time=120s
```

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

In MaxScale 2.3.9 and older versions, the minimum allowed value was 10 seconds
but, due to a bug, the default value was 0 which allowed infinite refreshes.

### `users_refresh_interval`

How often, in seconds, MaxScale will automatically refresh the users from the
backend server.

This configuration is used to periodically refresh the backend users, making sure
they are up to date. The default value for this setting is 0, meaning the users
are not periodically refreshed. However, they can still be refreshed in case of
failed authentication depending on `users_refresh_time`.
```
users_refresh_interval=2h
```

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4.

### `retain_last_statements`

How many statements MaxScale should store for each session. This is for
debugging purposes, as in case of problems it is often of value to be able
to find out exactly what statements were sent before a particular
problem turned up.

**Note:** See also `dump_last_statements` using which the actual dumping
  of the statements is enabled. Unless both of the parameters are defined,
  the statement dumping mechanism doesn't work.

```
retain_last_statements=20
```

Default is `0`.

### `dump_last_statements`

With this configuration item it is specified in what circumstances MaxScale
should dump the last statements that a client sent. The allowed values are
`never`, `on_error` and `on_close`. With `never` the statements are never
logged, with `on_error` they are logged if the client closes the connection
improperly, and with `on_close` they are always logged when a client session
is closed.
```
dump_last_statements=on_error
```
Default is `never`.

Note that you need to specify with `retain_last_statements` how many statements
MaxScale should retain for each session. Unless it has been set to another value
than `0`, this configuration setting will not have an effect.

### `session_trace`

How many log entries are stored in the session specific trace log. This log is
written to disk when a session ends abnormally and can be used for debugging
purposes. It would be good to enable this if a session is disconnected and the
log is not detailed enough. In this case the info log might reveal the true
cause of why the connection was closed.

```
session_trace=20
```
Default is `0`.

The session trace log is also exposed by REST API and is shown with
`maxctrl show sessions`.

### `writeq_high_water`

High water mark for network write buffer. When the size of the outbound network
buffer in MaxScale for a single connection exceeds this value, network traffic
throtting for that connection is started. The parameter accepts
[size type values](#sizes). The default value is 16777216 bytes.

More specifically, if the client side write queue is above this value, it will
block traffic coming from backend servers. If the backend side write queue is
above this value, it will block traffic from client.

The buffer that this parameter controls is the buffer internal to MaxScale and
is not the kernel TCP send buffer. This means that the total amount of buffered
data is determined by both the kernel TCP buffers and the value of
`writeq_high_water`.

Network throttling is only enabled when both `writeq_high_water` and
`writeq_low_water` have a non-zero value. To disable throttling, set the value
to 0.

### `writeq_low_water`

Low water mark for network write buffer. Once the traffic throttling is enabled,
it will only be disabled when the network write buffer is below
`writeq_low_water` bytes. The parameter accepts [size type values](#sizes). The
default value is 8192 bytes.

The value of `writeq_high_water` must always be greater than the value of
`writeq_low_water`.

Network throttling is only enabled when both `writeq_high_water` and
`writeq_low_water` have a non-zero value. To disable throttling, set the value
to 0.

### `load_persisted_configs`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: No

Load persisted runtime changes on startup. This parameter was added in MaxScale
2.3.6.

All runtime configuration changes are persisted in generated configuration files
located by default in `/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale.cnf.d/` and are loaded on
startup after main configuration files have been read. To make runtime
configurations volatile (i.e. they are lost when maxscale is restarted), use
`load_persisted_configs=false`. All changes are still persisted since it stores
the current runtime state of MaxScale. This makes problem analysis easier if an
unexpected outage happens.

### `max_auth_errors_until_block`

The maximum number of authentication failures that are tolerated before a host
is temporarily blocked. The default value is 10 failures. After a host is
blocked, connections from it are rejected for 60 seconds. To disable this
feature, set the value to 0.

Note that the configured value is not a hard limit. The number of tolerated
failures is between `max_auth_errors_until_block` and `threads *
max_auth_errors_until_block` where `max_auth_errors_until_block` is the
configured value of this parameter and `threads` is the number of configured
threads.

### `debug`

Define debug options from the --debug command line option. Either the command
line option or the parameter should be used, not both. The debug options are
only for testing purposes and are not to be used in production.

### REST API Configuration

The MaxScale REST API is an HTTP interface that provides JSON format data
intended to be consumed by monitoring appllications and visualization tools.

The following options must be defined under the `[maxscale]` section in the
configuration file.

### `admin_host`

The network interface where the REST API listens on. The default value is the
IPv4 address `127.0.0.1` which only listens for local connections.

### `admin_port`

The port where the REST API listens on. The default value is port 8989.

### `admin_auth`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: No

Enable REST API authentication using HTTP Basic Access
authentication. This is not a secure method of authentication without HTTPS but
it does add a small layer of security.

For more information, read the [REST API documentation](../REST-API/API.md).

### `admin_ssl_key`

The path to the TLS private key in PEM format for the admin interface.

If the `admin_ssl_key` and `admin_ssl_cert` options are all defined, the admin
interface will use encrypted HTTPS instead of plain HTTP.

### `admin_ssl_cert`

The path to the TLS public certificate in PEM format. See `admin_ssl_key`
documentation for more details.

### `admin_ssl_ca_cert`

The path to the TLS CA certificate in PEM format. If defined, the client
certificate, if provided, will be validated against it. This parameter is
optional starting with MaxScale 2.3.19.

### `admin_ssl_version`

Controls the minimum TLS version required to use the REST API.

Accepted values are:

 * TLSv10
 * TLSv11
 * TLSv12
 * TLSv13
 * MAX

The default value is MAX which negotiates the highest level of encryption that
both the client and server support. The list of supported TLS versions depends
on the operating system and what TLS versions the GnuTLS library supports.

This parameter was added in MaxScale 2.5.7.

### `admin_enabled`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: No

Enable or disable the admin interface. This allows the admin interface to
be completely disabled to prevent access to it.

### `admin_gui`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: No

Enable or disable the admin graphical user interface.

MaxScale provides a GUI for administrative operations via the REST API. When the
GUI is enabled, the root REST API resource (i.e. `http://localhost:8989/`) will
serve the GUI. When disabled, the REST API will respond with a 200 OK to the
request. By disabling the GUI, the root resource can be used as a low overhead
health check.

### `admin_secure_gui`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: No

Whether to serve the GUI only over secure HTTPS connections.

To be secure by default, the GUI is only served over HTTPS connections as
it uses a token authentication scheme. This also controls whether the
`/auth` endpoint requires an encrypted connection.

To allow use of the GUI without having to configure TLS certificates for
the MaxScale REST API, set this parameter to false.

### `admin_log_auth_failures`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Log authentication failures for the admin interface.

### `admin_pam_readwrite_service` and `admin_pam_readonly_service`

Use Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for REST API authentication. The settings
accept a PAM service name which is used during authentication if normal authentication
fails. `admin_pam_readwrite_service` should accept users who can do any
MaxCtrl/REST-API-operation. `admin_pam_readonly_service` should accept users who can only
do read operations. Because REST-API does not support back and forth communication between
the client and MaxScale, the PAM services must be simple. They should only ask for the
password and nothing else.

If only `admin_pam_readwrite_service` is configured, both read and write operations can be
authenticated by PAM. If only `admin_pam_readonly_service` is configured, only read
operations can be authenticated by PAM. If both are set, the service used is determined by
the requested operation. Leave or set both empty to disable PAM for REST-API.

### `config_sync_cluster`

- **Type**: monitor
- **Default**: No default value
- **Dynamic**: Yes

This parameter controls which cluster is used to synchronize configuration
changes between MaxScale instances. By default configuration synchronization is
not enabled and it must be explicitly enabled by defining a monitor name for
`config_sync_cluster`.

When `config_sync_cluster` is defined, `config_sync_user` and
`config_sync_password` must also be defined.

For a detailed description of this feature, refer to the [Configuration
Synchronization](#configuration-synchronization) section.

### `config_sync_user`

- **Type**: string
- **Default**: No default value
- **Dynamic**: Yes

The username for the account that is used to synchronize configuration changes
across MaxScale instances. Both this parameter and `config_sync_password` are
required if `config_sync_cluster` is configured.

This account must have the following grants:

```
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, CREATE ON `mysql`.`maxscale_config`
```

### `config_sync_password`

- **Type**: string
- **Default**: No default value
- **Dynamic**: Yes

The password for `config_sync_user`. Both this parameter and `config_sync_user`
are required if `config_sync_cluster` is configured.

### `config_sync_interval`

- **Type**: duration
- **Default**: 5s
- **Dynamic**: Yes

How often to synchronize the configuration with the cluster.

As the synchronization involves selecting the configuration version from the
database, this value should not be set to an unreasonably low value. The default
value of 5 second should provide a good compromise between responsiveness and
how much load it places on the database.

### `config_sync_timeout`

- **Type**: duration
- **Default**: 10s
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Timeout for all SQL operations done during the configuration synchronization. If
an operation exceeds this timeout, the configuration change is treated as failed
and an error is reported to the client that did the change.

## Events

MaxScale logs warnings and errors for various reasons and often it is self-
evident and generally applicable whether some occurence should warrant a
warning or an error, or perhaps just an info-level message.

However, there are events whose seriousness is not self-evident. For
instance, in some environments an authentication failure may simply indicate
that someone has made a typo, while in some other environment that can only
happen in case there has been a security breech.

To handle events like these, MaxScale defines _events_ whose logging
facility and level can be controlled by the administrator. Given an event
`X`, its facility and level are controlled in the following manner:
```
event.X.facility=LOG_LOCAL0
event.X.level=LOG_ERR
```
The above means that if event _X_ occurs, then that is logged using the
facility `LOG_LOCAL0` and the level `LOG_ERR`.

The valid values of facility` are the facility values reported by `man
syslog`, e.g. `LOG_AUTH`, `LOG_LOCAL0` and `LOG_USER`. Likewise, the valid
values for `level` are the ones also reported by `man syslog`,
e.g. `LOG_WARNING`, `LOG_ERR` and `LOG_CRIT`.

Note that MaxScale does not act upon the level, that is, even if the level
of a particular event is defined to be `LOG_EMERG`, MaxScale will not shut
down if that event occurs.

The default facility is `LOG_USER` and the default level is `LOG_WARNING`.

Note that you may also have to configure `rsyslog` to ensure that the
event can be logged to the intended log file. For instance, if the facility
is chosen to be `LOG_AUTH`, then `/etc/rsyslog.conf` should contain a line
like
```
auth,authpriv.*                 /var/log/auth.log
```
for the logged events to end up in `/var/log/auth.log`, where the initial
`auth` is the relevant entry.

The available events are:

### 'authentication_failure'

This event occurs when there is an authentication failure.
```
event.authentication_failure.facility=LOG_AUTH
event.authentication_failure.level=LOG_CRIT
```

## Service

A service represents the database service that MariaDB MaxScale offers to the
clients. In general a service consists of a set of backend database servers and
a routing algorithm that determines how MariaDB MaxScale decides to send
statements or route connections to those backend servers.

A service may be considered as a virtual database server that MariaDB MaxScale
makes available to its clients.

Several different services may be defined using the same set of backend servers.
For example a connection based routing service might be used by clients that
already performed internal read/write splitting, whilst a different statement
based router may be used by clients that are not written with this functionality
in place. Both sets of applications could access the same data in the same
databases.

A service is identified by a service name, which is the name of the
configuration file section and a type parameter of service.

```
[Test-Service]
type=service
```

In order for MariaDB MaxScale to forward any requests it must have at least one
service defined within the configuration file. The definition of a service alone
is not enough to allow MariaDB MaxScale to forward requests however, the service
is merely present to link together the other configuration elements.

### `router`

The router parameter of a service defines the name of the router module that
will be used to implement the routing algorithm between the client of MariaDB
MaxScale and the backend databases. Additionally routers may also be passed a
comma separated list of options that are used to control the behavior of the
routing algorithm. The two parameters that control the routing choice are router
and router_options. The router options are specific to a particular router and
are used to modify the behavior of the router. The read connection router can be
passed options of master, slave or synced, an example of configuring a service
to use this router and limiting the choice of servers to those in slave state
would be as follows.

```
router=readconnroute
router_options=slave
```

To change the router to connect on to servers in the  master state as well as
slave servers, the router options can be modified to include the master state.

```
router=readconnroute
router_options=master,slave
```

A more complete description of router options and what is available for a given
router is included with the documentation of the router itself.

### `router_options`

Option string given to the router module. The value of this parameter should be
a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. See router specific documentation for
more details.

### `filters`

The filters option allow a set of filters to be defined for a service; requests
from the client are passed through these filters before being sent to the router
for dispatch to the backend server.  The filters parameter takes one or more
filter names, as defined within the filter definition section of the
configuration file. Multiple filters are separated using the | character.

```
filters=counter | QLA
```

The requests pass through the filters from left to right in the order defined in
the configuration parameter.

### `targets`

The `targets` parameter is a comma separated list of server and/or service names
that comprise the routing targets of the service. This parameter was added in
MaxScale 2.5.0.

```
targets=My-Service,server2
```

This parameter allows nested service configurations to be defined without having
to configure listeners for all services. For example, one use-case is to use
multiple readwritesplit services behind a schemarouter service to have both the
sharding of schemarouter with the high-availability of readwritesplit.

**NOTE:** The `targets` parameter is mutually exclusive with the `cluster` and
  `servers` parameters.

### `servers`

The servers parameter in a service definition provides a comma separated list of
the backend servers that comprise the service. The server names are those used
in the name section of a block with a type parameter of server (see below).

```
servers=server1,server2,server3
```

**NOTE:** The `servers` parameter is mutually exclusive with the `cluster` and
  `targets` parameters.

### `cluster`

The servers the service uses are defined by the monitor specified as value
of this configuration parameter.

```
cluster=TheMonitor

```

**NOTE:** The `cluster` parameter is mutually exclusive with the `servers` and
  `targets` parameters.

### `user` and `password`

These settings define the credentials the service uses to fetch user account
information from backends. The *password* may be either a plain text password or
an [encrypted password](#encrypting-passwords).

```
user=maxscale
password=Mhu87p2D
```

See [MySQL protocol authentication documentation](../Authenticators/Authentication-Modules.md)
for more information (such as required grants) and troubleshooting tips
regarding user account management and client authentication.

### `enable_root_user`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

This parameter controls the ability of the root user to connect to MariaDB
MaxScale and hence onwards to the backend servers via MariaDB MaxScale.

### `localhost_match_wildcard_host`

Deprecated and ignored.

### `version_string`

This parameter sets a custom version string that is sent in the MySQL Handshake
from MariaDB MaxScale to clients.

Example:

```
version_string=5.5.37-MariaDB-RWsplit
```

If not set, the default value is `5.5.5-10.0.0 MaxScale <MaxScale version>`
where `<MaxScale version>` is the version of MaxScale. If the provided string
does not start with the number 5, a 5.5.5- prefix will be added to it. This
means that a _version_string_ value of _MaxScale-Service_ would result in a
_5.5.5-MaxScale-Service_ being sent to the client.

### `weightby`

This parameter has been removed. Server weights were deprecated in
MaxScale 2.3.2 and removed in MaxScale 2.5.0. The feature has been
replaced with the [`rank`](#rank) mechanism.

If this value is found in the MaxScale configuration, a warning is logged
and the value is ignored.

### `auth_all_servers`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

This parameter controls whether only a single server or all of the servers are
used when loading the users from the backend servers.

By default MaxScale uses the first server labeled as `Master` as the source of
the authentication data. When this option is enabled, the authentication data is
loaded from all the servers and combined into one big data set.

### `strip_db_esc`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: Yes

This setting controls whether escape characters (`\`) are removed from database
names when loading user grants from a backend server.  When enabled, a grant
such as ``grant select on `test\_`.* to 'user'@'%';`` is read as ``grant select
on `test_`.* to 'user'@'%';``

This setting has no effect on database-level grants fetched from a MariaDB
Server. The database names of a MariaDB Server are compared using the LIKE
operator to properly handle wildcards and escaped wildcards. This setting may
affect database names in table and column level grants, although these typically
do not contain backlashes.

This setting does affect database names when reading grants from an
Xpand-server.

Some visual database management tools automatically escape some characters and
this might cause conflicts when MaxScale tries to authenticate users.

### `log_auth_warnings`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Enable or disable the logging of authentication failures and warnings. If
enabled, messages about failed authentication attempts will be logged with
details about who tried to connect to MariaDB MaxScale and from where.

### `log_warning`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

When enabled, this allows a service to log warning messages even if the global
log level configuration disables them.

Note that disabling the service level logging does not override the global
logging configuration: with `log_warning=false` in the service and
`log_warning=true` globally, warnings will still be logged for all services.

### `log_notice`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

When enabled, this allows a service to log notice messages even if the global
log level configuration disables them.

### `log_info`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

When enabled, this allows a service to log info messages even if the global log
level configuration disables them.

### `log_debug`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

When enabled, this allows a service to log debug messages even if the global log
level configuration disables them.

Debug messages are only enabled for debug builds. Enabling `log_debug` in a
release build does nothing.

### `connection_timeout`

The connection_timeout parameter is used to disconnect sessions to MariaDB
MaxScale that have been idle for too long. The session timeouts are disabled by
default. To enable them, define the timeout in seconds in the service's
configuration section. A value of zero is interpreted as no timeout, the same
as if the parameter is not defined.

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

**Warning:** If a connection is idle for longer than the configured connection
timeout, it will be forcefully disconnected and a warning will be logged in the
MaxScale log file.

In MaxScale versions 6.2.0 and older, if long-running operations (e.g. `ALTER
TABLE`) were performed, MaxScale would close the connections if they look longer
than `connection_timeout` seconds to execute
([MXS-3893](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-3893)). In MaxScale 6.2.1 this
has been fixed and the active operations are now correctly tracked.

Example:

```
[Test-Service]
connection_timeout=300s
```

### `max_connections`

The maximum number of simultaneous connections MaxScale should permit to this
service. If the parameter is zero or is omitted, there is no limit. Any attempt
to make more connections after the limit is reached will result in a "Too many
connections" error being returned.

Example:

```
[Test-Service]
max_connections=100
```

### `session_track_trx_state`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Enable or disable session transaction state tracking by offloading it to the backend servers.
Getting current session transaction state from server side will be more accurate for that state
inside stored procedures or prepare statments will be handle properly, and that is also faster
as no parsing is needed on MaxScale.

This is only supported by MariaDB versions 10.3 or newer. Default is false.
The following Server side config is needed too.

```
session_track_state_change = ON
session_track_transaction_info = CHARACTERISTICS
```

### `retain_last_statements`

How many statements MaxScale should store for each session of this service.
This overrides the value of the global setting with the same name. If
`retain_last_statements` has been specified in the global section of the
MaxScale configuration file, then if it has _not_ been explicitly specified
for the service, the global value holds, otherwise the service specific
value rules. That is, it is possible to enable the setting globally and
turn it off for a specific service, or just enable it for specific services.

The value of this parameter can be changed at runtime using `maxctrl` and the
new value will take effect for sessions created thereafter.

```
maxctrl alter service MyService retain_last_statements 5
```

### `connection_keepalive`

Keep idle connections alive by sending pings to backend servers. This feature
was introduced in MaxScale 2.5.0 where it was changed from a
readwritesplit-specific feature to a generic service feature. The default value
for this parameter is 300 seconds. To disable this feature, set the value to 0.

The keepalive interval is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no
explicit unit is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale
2.5. In subsequent versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that
since the granularity of the keepalive is seconds, a keepalive specified in
milliseconds will be rejected, even if the duration is longer than a second.

The parameter value is the interval in seconds between each keepalive ping. A
keepalive ping will be sent to a backend server if the connection has been idle
for longer than the configured keepalive interval.

This parameter only takes effect in top-level services. A top-level service is
the service where the listener that the client connected to points (i.e. the
value of `service` in the listener). If a service defines other services in its
`targets` parameter, the `connection_keepalive` for those is not used.

If the value of `connection_keepalive` is changed at runtime, the change in the
value takes effect immediately.

As the connection keepalive pings must be done only when there's no ongoing
query, all requests and responses must be tracked by MaxScale. In the case of
`readconnroute`, this will incur a small drop in performance. For routers that
rely on result tracking (e.g. `readwritesplit` and `schemarouter`), the
performance will be the same with or without `connection_keepalive`.

If you want to avoid the performance cost and you don't need the connection
keepalive feature, you can disable it with `connection_keepalive=0s`.

### `net_write_timeout`

This parameter controls how long a network write to the client can stay
buffered. This feature is disabled by default.

When `net_write_timeout` is configured and data is buffered on the client
network connection, if the time since the last successful network write exceeds
the configured limit, the client connection will be disconnected.

The value is specified as documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit
is provided, the value is interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent
versions a value without a unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity
of the timeout is seconds, a timeout specified in milliseconds will be rejected,
even if the duration is longer than a second.

### `max_sescmd_history`

`max_sescmd_history` sets a limit on how many distinct session commands each
session can execute before the session command history is disabled. The default
is 50 session commands.

If you have long-running sessions which change the session state often, increase
the value of this parameter if server reconnections fail due to disabled session
command history.

When a limitation is set, it effectively creates a cap on the session's memory
consumption. This might be useful if connection pooling is used and the sessions
use large amounts of session commands.

This parameter was moved into the MaxScale core in MaxScale 6.0. The parameter
can be configured for all routers that support the session command
history. Currently only `readwritesplit` and `schemarouter` support it.

### `prune_sescmd_history`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: true
- **Dynamic**: Yes

This option enables pruning of the session command history when it exceeds the
value configured in `max_sescmd_history`. When this option is enabled, only a
set number of statements are stored in the history. This limits the per-session
memory use while still allowing safe reconnections.

This parameter is intended to be used with pooled connections that remain in use
for a very long time. Most connection pool implementations do not reset the
session state and instead re-initialize it with new values. This causes the
session command history to grow at roughly a constant rate for the lifetime of
the pooled connection.

Each client-side session that uses a pooled connection only executes a finite
amount of session commands. By retaining a shorter history that encompasses all
session commands the individual clients execute, the session state of a pooled
connection can be accurately recreated on another server.

When the session command history pruning is enabled, there is a theoretical
possibility that upon server reconnection the session states of the connections
are inconsistent. This can only happen if the length of the stored history is
shorter than the list of relevant statements that affect the session state. In
practice the default value of 50 session commands is a fairly reasonable value
and the risk of inconsistent session state is relatively low.

In case the default history length is too short for safe pruning, set the value
of `max_sescmd_history` to the total number of commands that affect the session
state plus a safety margin of 10. The safety margin reserves some extra space
for new commands that might be executed due to changes in the client side
application.

This parameter was moved into the MaxScale core in MaxScale 6.0. The parameter
can be configured for all routers that support the session command
history. Currently only `readwritesplit` and `schemarouter` support it.

### `disable_sescmd_history`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

This option disables the session command history. This way no history is stored
and if a slave server fails, the router will not try to replace the failed
slave. Disabling session command history will allow long-lived connections
without causing a constant growth in the memory consumption.

This parameter should only be used when either the memory footprint must be as
small as possible or when the pruning of the session command history is not
acceptable.

This parameter was moved into the MaxScale core in MaxScale 6.0. The parameter
can be configured for all routers that support the session command
history. Currently only `readwritesplit` and `schemarouter` support it.

### `user_accounts_file`

Defines path to a file with additional user accounts for incoming clients.
Default value is empty, which disables the feature.
```
user_accounts_file=/home/root/users.json
```

In addition to querying the backends, MaxScale can read users from a file. This
feature is useful when backends have limitations on the type of users that can
be created (e.g. XPand), or if MaxScale needs to allow users to log in even
when backends are down (e.g. binlog router). The users read from the file are
only present on MaxScale, so logging into backends can still fail. The format of
the file is protocol-specific. The following only applies to MariaDB-protocol,
which is also the only protocol supporting this feature.

The file contains json text. Three objects are read from it: *user*, *db* and
*roles_mapping*, none of which are mandatory. These objects must be arrays which
contain user information similar to the *mysql.user*, *mysql.db* and
*mysql.roles_mapping* tables on the server. Each array element must define at
least the string fields "user" and "host", which define the user account to add
or modify.

The elements in the *user*-array may contain the following additional fields. If
a field is not defined, it is assumed either empty (string) or false (boolean).
- "password": String. Password hash, similar to the equivalent column on server.
- "plugin": String. Authentication plugin used by client, similar to server.
- "authentication_string": String. Additional authentication info, similar to server.
- "default_role": String. Default role of user, similar to server.
- "super_priv": Boolean. True if user has SUPER grant.
- "global_db_priv": Boolean. True if user can access any database on login.
- "proxy_priv": Boolean. True if user has a PROXY grant.
- "is_role": Boolean. True if user is a role.

The elements in the *db*-array must contain the following additional field:
- "db": String. Database which the user can access. Can contain % and _ wildcards.

The elements in the *roles_mapping*-array must contain the following additional
field:
- "role": String. Role the user can access.

When users are read from both servers and the file, the server takes priority.
That is, if user `'joe'@'%'` is defined on both, the file-version is discarded.
The file can still affect the database grants and roles of `'joe'@'%'`, as the
*db* and *roles_mapping*-arrays are read separately and added to existing grant
and role lists.

An example users file is below.
```
{
    "user": [
        {
            "user": "test1",
            "host": "%",
            "global_db_priv": true
        },
        {
            "user": "test2",
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "password": "*032169CDF0B90AF8C00992D43D354E29A2EACB42",
            "plugin": "mysql_native_password",
            "default_role": "role2"
        },
        {
            "user": "",
            "host": "%",
            "plugin": "pam",
            "proxy_priv": true
        }
    ],
    "db": [
        {
            "user": "test2",
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "db": "test"
        }
    ],
    "roles_mapping": [
        {
            "user": "test2",
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "role": "role2"
        }
    ]
}
```

### `user_accounts_file_usage`

Defines when *user_accounts_file* is read. The value is an enum, either
"add_when_load_ok" (default) or "file_only_always".

"add_when_load_ok" means that the file is only read when users are successfully
read from a server. The file contents are then added to the server-based data.
If reading from server fails (e.g. servers are down), the file is ignored.

"file_only_always" means that users are not read from the servers at all and the
file contents is all that matters. The state of the servers is ignored. This
mode can be useful with the binlog router, as it allows clients to log in and
fetch binary logs from MaxScale even when backend servers are down.

```
user_accounts_file_usage=file_only_always
```

### `idle_session_pool_time`

Normally, MaxScale only pools backend connections when a session is closed
(controlled by server settings *persistpoolmax* and *persistmaxtime*).
Connections in the pool can then be attached to new sessions instead of creating
new connections to backends. *idle_session_pool_time* allows MaxScale to pool backend
connections also for running sessions, and only re-attach the connection when the
session is doing a query. This effectively allows multiple sessions to share
backends connections. This *pre-emptive pooling* only affects idle sessions.

*idle_session_pool_time* is given in seconds, and defines the amount of time a
session must be idle before its backend connections may be pooled. It defaults
to -1 seconds, which means disabled. All negative values disable this
feature. If configured to a value of zero seconds, all connections that are idle
are put back into the pool as soon as possible.

This feature has a significant drawback: when a backend connection is reused, it
needs to be restored to a correct state. This means reauthenticating and
replaying session commands. This can add a significant delay before the
connection is actually ready for a query. If the session command history size
exceeds the value of *max_sescmd_history*, pre-emptive pooling is disabled for
the session.

This feature should only be used when minimizing the backend connection count is
a priority, even at the cost of query delay and throughput. Also, see server
setting [max_routing_connections](#max_routing_connections).

```
idle_session_pool_time=10
```

#### Details, limitations and suggestions for pre-emptive pooling

As noted above, when a connection is pooled and reused its state is lost.
Although session variables and prepared statements are restored by replaying
session commands, some state information cannot be transferred.

The most common such state is a transaction. When a transaction is on, pooling
is disabled for that session until the transaction completes. Other similar
situations may not be properly detected, and it's the responsibility of the user
to avoid introducing such state to the session when using pre-emptive pooling.
This means that the following should not be used:

* Statements such as `LOCK TABLES` and `GET LOCK` or any other statement that
  introduces state into the connection.

* Temporary tables and some problematic user or session variables such as
 `LAST_INSERT_ID()`. For `LAST_INSERT_ID()`, the value returned by the connector
  must be used instead of the variable.

* Stored procedures that cause session level side-effects.

Several settings affect pre-emptive pooling and its effectiveness. Reusing a
connection is an expensive operation so its frequency should be minimized. The
important configuration settings in addition to
*idle_session_pool_time* are server settings
[persistpoolmax](#persistpoolmax),
[persistmaxtime](#persistmaxtime) and
[max_routing_connections](#max_routing_connections).
The service settings [max_sescmd_history](#max_sescmd_history) and
[prune_sescmd_history](#prune_sescmd_history) also have an effect. Tuning these
settings will likely involve plenty of trial and error as use cases differ.

*persistpoolmax* limits how many connections can be kept in a pool for a given
server. If the pool is full, no more connections are detached from sessions even
if they are idle. To minimize unnecessary pooling and reusing, the pool maximum
size should be large enough to accomodate any sudden need for connections yet
not be unnecessarily large. For example, if the application is estimated to only
activate 1000 connections in any given *idle_session_pool_time* length cycle,
perhaps having 1500 connections in the pool is enough. This would allow other
MaxScale sessions to keep their backend connections for any sudden queries.

*persistmaxtime* limits the time a connection may stay in the pool. This should
be high enough so that pooled connections are not unnecessarily closed. As
stated above, a full pool allows sessions to hold on to their backend
connections, reducing connection ping-pong. Cleaning clearly unneeded
connections from the pool may be useful when *max_routing_connections* is
restrictively tuned. Because each MaxScale routing thread has its own connection
pool, one thread can monopolize access to a server. For example, if the pool of
thread 1 has 100 connections to *ServerA* with `max_routing_connections=100`,
other threads can no longer connect to the server. In such a situation,
reducing *persistmaxtime* of *ServerA* may help as it would cause unneeded
connections in the pool to be closed faster. Such connection slots then become
available to other routing threads. Reducing the number of
[routing threads](#threads) may also help, as it reduces pool fracturing. This
may reduce overall throughput, though.

If a client session exceeds *max_sescmd_history* (default 50), pooling is
disabled for that session. If many sessions do this and
*max_routing_connections* is set, other sessions will stall as they cannot find
a backend connection. This can be avoided with *prune_sescmd_history*. However,
pruning means that old session commands will not be replayed when a pooled
connection is reused. If the pruned commands are important
(e.g. statement preparations), the session may fail later on.

## Server

Server sections define the backend database servers MaxScale uses. A server is
identified by its section name in the configuration file. The only mandatory
parameter of a server is *type*, but *address* and *port* are also usually
defined. A server may be a member of one or more services. A server may only be
monitored by at most one monitor.

```
[MyMariaDBServer1]
type=server
address=127.0.0.1
port=3000
```

### `address`

The IP-address or hostname of the machine running the database server. MaxScale
uses this address to connect to the server. This parameter is mandatory unless
*socket* is defined.

### `port`

The port the backend server listens on for incoming connections. MaxScale uses
this port to connect to the server. The default value is 3306.

### `socket`

The absolute path to a UNIX domain socket the MariaDB server is listening
on. Either *address* or *socket* must be defined and defining them both is an
error.

### `monitoruser` and `monitorpw`

These settings define a server-specific username and password for monitoring the
server. Monitors typically use the credentials in their own configuration
sections to connect to all servers. If server-specific settings are given, the
monitor uses those instead.

```
monitoruser=mymonitoruser
monitorpw=mymonitorpasswd
```

`monitorpw` may be either a plain text password or an encrypted password.  See
the section [encrypting passwords](#encrypting-passwords) for more information.

### `extra_port`

An alternative port used for administrative connections to the server.  If this
setting is defined, MaxScale uses it for monitoring the server and to fetch user
accounts. Client sessions will still use the normal port.

Defining *extra_port* allows MaxScale to connect even when *max_connections* on
the backend server has been reached. Extra-port connections have their own
connection limit, which is one by default. This needs to be increased to allow
both monitor and user account manager to connect.

If the connection to the extra-port fails due to connection number limit or if
the port is not open on the server, normal port is used.

For more information, see
[extra_port](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/thread-pool-system-and-status-variables/#extra_port)
and [extra_max_connections](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/thread-pool-system-status-variables/#extra_max_connections).

### `persistpoolmax`

The `persistpoolmax` parameter defaults to zero but can be set to an integer
value for a back end server. If it is non zero, then when a DCB connected to a
back end server is discarded by the system, it will be held in a pool for reuse,
remaining connected to the back end server. If the number of DCBs in the pool
has reached the value given by `persistpoolmax` then any further DCB that is
discarded will not be retained, but disconnected and discarded.

When a MariaDB protocol connection is taken from the pool, the state of the
session is reset. This means that a pooled connection works exactly like a fresh
connection.

### `persistmaxtime`

The `persistmaxtime` parameter defaults to zero but can be set to a duration as
documented [here](#durations). If no explicit unit is provided, the value is
interpreted as seconds in MaxScale 2.4. In subsequent versions a value without a
unit may be rejected. Note that since the granularity of the parameter is
seconds, a value specified in milliseconds will be rejected, even if the
duration is longer than a second.

A DCB placed in the persistent pool for a server will only be reused if the
elapsed time since it joined the pool is less than the given value. Otherwise,
the DCB will be discarded and the connection closed.

### `max_routing_connections`

Maximum number of routing connections to this server. Connections held in a pool
also count towards this maximum. Does not limit monitor connections or user
account fetching. A value of 0 (default) means no limit.

Since every client session can generate a connection to a server, the server may
run out of memory when the number of clients is high enough. This setting limits
server memory use caused by MaxScale. The effect depends on if the service
setting [idle_session_pool_time](#idle_session_pool_time), i.e. pre-emptive
pooling, is enabled or not.

If pre-emptive pooling is not on, *max_routing_connections* simply sets a limit.
Any sessions attempting to exceed this limit will fail to connect to the
backend. The client can still connect to MaxScale, but queries will fail.

If pre-emptive pooling is on, sessions exceeding the limit will be put on hold
until a connection is available. Such sessions will appear unresponsive, as
queries will hang, possibly for a long time. This feature is best used in a
situation where most sessions are idle, so that backend connections are usually
available from the pool.

```
max_routing_connections=1234
```

### `proxy_protocol`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

If `proxy_protocol` is enabled, MaxScale will send a
[PROXY protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt)
header when connecting client sessions to the server. The header contains the
original client IP address and port, as seen by MaxScale. The server will then
read the header and perform authentication as if the connection originated from
this address instead of MaxScale's IP address. With this feature, the user
accounts on the backend server can be simplified to only contain the actual
client hosts and not the MaxScale host.

PROXY protocol will be supported by MariaDB 10.3, which this feature has been
tested with. To use it, enable the PROXY protocol in MaxScale for every
compatible server and configure the MariaDB servers themselves to accept the
protocol headers from MaxScale's IP address. On the server side, the protocol
should be enabled  only for trusted IPs, as it allows the sender to spoof the
connection origin. If a proxy header is sent to a server not expecting it, the
connection will fail. Usually PROXY protocol should be enabled for every
server in a cluster, as they typically have similar grants.

Other SQL-servers may support PROXY protocol as well, but the implementation may
be highly restricting. Strict adherence to the protocol requires that the
backend server does not allow mixing of un-proxied and proxied connections from
a given IP. MaxScale requires normal connections to backends for monitoring and
authentication data queries, which would be blocked. To bypass this restriction,
the server monitor needs to be disabled and the service listener needs to be
configured to disregard authentication errors (`skip_authentication=true`).
Server states also need to be set manually in MaxCtrl. These steps are *not*
required for MariaDB 10.3, since its implementation is more flexible and allows
both PROXY-headered and headerless connections from a proxy-enabled IP.

### `disk_space_threshold`

This parameter specifies how full a disk may be, before MaxScale should start
logging warnings or take other actions (e.g. perform a switchover). This
functionality will only work with MariaDB server versions 10.1.32, 10.2.14 and
10.3.6 onwards, if the `DISKS` _information schema plugin_ has been installed.

**NOTE**: In future MariaDB versions, the information will be available _only_ if
the monitor user has the `FILE` privilege.

A limit is specified as a path followed by a colon and a percentage specifying
how full the corresponding disk may be, before action is taken. E.g. an entry like
```
/data:80
```
specifies that the disk that has been mounted on `/data` may be used until 80%
of the total space has been consumed. Multiple entries can be specified by
separating them by a comma. If the path is specified using `*`, then the limit
applies to all disks. However, the value of `*` is only applied if there is not
an exact match.

Note that if a particular disk has been mounted on several paths, only one path
need to be specified. If several are specified, then the one with the smallest
percentage will be applied.

Examples:
```
disk_space_threshold=*:80
disk_space_threshold=/data:80
disk_space_threshold=/data1:80,/data2:60,*:90
```
The last line means that the disk mounted at `/data1` may be used up to
80%, the disk mounted at `/data2` may be used up to 60% and all other disks
mounted at any paths may be used up until 90% of maximum capacity, before
MaxScale starts to warn to take action.

Note that the path to be used, is one of the paths returned by:
```
> use information_schema;
> select * from disks;
+-----------+----------------------+-----------+----------+-----------+
| Disk      | Path                 | Total     | Used     | Available |
+-----------+----------------------+-----------+----------+-----------+
| /dev/sda3 | /                    |  47929956 | 34332348 |  11139820 |
| /dev/sdb1 | /data                | 961301832 |    83764 | 912363644 |
...
```

There is no default value, but this parameter must be explicitly specified
if the disk space situation should be monitored.

### `rank`

This parameter controls the order in which servers are used. Valid values for
this parameter are `primary` and `secondary`. The default value is
`primary`. This parameter replaces the use of the `weightby` parameter as the
primary means of controlling server usage.

This behavior depends on the router implementation but the general rule of thumb
is that primary servers will be used before secondary servers.

Readconnroute will always use primary servers before secondary servers as long
as they match the configured server type.

Readwritesplit will pick servers that have the same rank as the current
master. Read the
[readwritesplit documentation on server ranks](../Routers/ReadWriteSplit.md#server-ranks)
for a detailed description of the behavior.

The following example server configuration demonstrates how `rank` can be used
to exclude `DR-site` servers from routing.

```
[main-site-master]
type=server
address=192.168.0.11
rank=primary

[main-site-slave]
type=server
address=192.168.0.12
rank=primary

[DR-site-master]
type=server
address=192.168.0.21
rank=secondary

[DR-site-slave]
type=server
address=192.168.0.22
rank=secondary
```

The `main-site-master` and `main-site-slave` servers will be used as long as
they are available. When they are no longer available, the `DR-site-master` and
`DR-site-slave` will be used.

## Monitor

Monitor sections are used to define the monitoring module that watches a set of
servers. Each server can only be monitored by one monitor.

Common monitor parameters [can be found here](../Monitors/Monitor-Common.md).

## Listener

A listener defines a port MaxScale listens on for incoming connections. Accepted
connections are linked with a MaxScale service. Multiple listeners can feed the
same service. Mandatory parameters are *type*, *service* and *protocol*.
*address* is optional, it limits connections to a certain network interface
only. *socket* is also optional and is used for Unix socket connections.

The network socket where the listener listens may have a backlog of
connections. The size of this backlog is controlled by the
*net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog* and *net.core.somaxconn* kernel parameters.

Increasing the size of the backlog by modifying the kernel parameters helps with
sudden connection spikes and rejected connections. For more information see
[listen(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html).

```
[MyListener1]
type=listener
service=MyService1
protocol=MariaDBClient
port=3006
```

### `service`

The service to which the listener is associated. This is the name of a service
that is defined elsewhere in the configuration file.

### `protocol`

The name of the protocol module used for communication between the client and
MaxScale. The same protocol is also used for backend communication. Usually this
is set to `MariaDBClient`.

### `address`

This sets the address the listening socket is bound to. The address may be
specified as an IP address in 'dot notation' or as a hostname. If left undefined
the listener will bind to all network interfaces.

### `port`

The port the listener listens on. If left undefined a default port for the
protocol is used.

### `socket`

If defined, the listener uses Unix domain sockets to listen for incoming
connections. The parameter value is the name of the socket to use.

If you want to use both network ports and UNIX domain sockets with a service,
define two separate listeners that connect to the same service.

### `authenticator`

The authenticator module to use. Each protocol module defines a default
authentication module, which is used if the setting is left undefined.
*MariaDBClient*-protocol supports multiple authenticators and they can be used
simultaneously by giving a comma-separated list e.g.
`authenticator=PAMAuth,mysqlauth,gssapiauth`

### `authenticator_options`

This defines additional options for authentication. As of MaxScale 2.5.0, only
*MariaDBClient* and its authenticators support additional options. The value of
this parameter should be a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. See
authenticator specific documentation for more details.

### `sql_mode`

Specify the sql mode for the listener similarly to global `sql_mode` setting.
If both are used this setting will override the global setting for this listener.

### `connection_init_sql_file`

Path to a text file with sql queries. Any sessions created from the listener
will send the contents of the file to backends after authentication. Each
non-empty line in the file is interpreted as a query. Each query must succeed
for the backend connection to be usable for client queries. The queries should
not return any data.

```
connection_init_sql_file=/home/dba/init_queries.txt
```
Example query file:
```
set @myvar = 'mytext';
set @myvar2 = 4;
```

### `user_mapping_file`

Path to a json-text file with user and group mapping, as well as server
credentials. Only affects MariaDB-protocol based listeners. Default value is
empty, which disables the feature.
```
user_mapping_file=/home/root/mapping.json
```
Should not be used together with
[PAM Authenticator](../Authenticators/PAM-Authenticator.md)
settings `pam_backend_mapping` or `pam_mapped_pw_file`, as these may overwrite
the mapped credentials. Is most powerful when combined with service setting
`user_accounts_file`, as then MaxScale can accept users that do not exist on
backends and map them to backend users.

This file functions very similar to
[PAM-based mapping](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/user-and-group-mapping-with-pam/).
Both user-to-user and group-to-user mappings can be defined. Also, the password
and authentication plugin for the mapped users can be added. The file is only
read during listener creation (typically MaxScale start) or when a listener is
modified during runtime. When a client logs into MaxScale, their username is
searched from the mapping data. If the name matches either a name mapping or a
Linux group mapping, the username is replaced by the mapped name. The mapped
name is then used when logging into backends. If the file also contains
credentials for the mapped user, then those are used. Otherwise, MaxScale tries
to log in with an empty password and default MariaDB authentication.

Three arrays are read from the file: "user_map", "group_map" and
"server_credentials", none of which are mandatory.

Each array element in the "user_map"-array must define the following fields:
- "original_user": String. Incoming client username.
- "mapped_user": String. Username the client is mapped to.

Each array element in the "group_map"-array must define the following fields:
- "original_group": String. Incoming client Linux group.
- "mapped_user": String. Username the client is mapped to.

Each array element in the "server_credentials"-array can define the following
fields:
- "mapped_user": String. The mapped username this password is for.
- "password": String. Backend server password. Can be encrypted with *maxpasswd*.
- "plugin": String, optional. Authentication plugin to use. Must be enabled on
the listener. Defaults to empty, which results in standard MariaDB authentication.

When a client successfully logs into MaxScale, MaxScale first searches for
name-based mapping. The incoming client does not need to be a Linux user for
name-based mapping to take place. If the name is not found, MaxScale checks if
the client is a Linux user with a group membership matching an element in the
group mapping array. If the client is a member of more than 100 groups, this
check may fail.

If a mapping is found, MaxScale searches the credentials array for a matching
username, and uses the password and plugin listed. The plugin need not be the
same as the one the original user used. Currently, "mysql_native_password" and
"pam" are supported as mapped plugins.

An example mapping file is below.
```
{
    "user_map": [
        {
            "original_user": "bob",
            "mapped_user": "janet"
        },
        {
          "original_user": "karen",
          "mapped_user": "janet"
        }
    ],
    "group_map": [
        {
            "original_group": "visitors",
            "mapped_user": "db_user"
        }
    ],
    "server_credentials": [
        {
            "mapped_user": "janet",
            "password": "secret_pw",
            "plugin": "mysql_native_password"
        },
        {
            "mapped_user": "db_user",
            "password": "secret_pw2",
            "plugin": "pam"
        }
    ]
}
```

# Available Protocols

The protocols supported by MariaDB MaxScale are implemented as external modules
that are loaded dynamically into the MariaDB MaxScale core. They allow MariaDB
MaxScale to communicate in various protocols both on the client side and the
backend side. Each of the protocols can be either a client protocol or a backend
protocol. Client protocols are used for client-MariaDB MaxScale communication
and backend protocols are for MariaDB MaxScale-database communication.

## `MariaDBClient`

This is the implementation of the MySQL-protocol. When defined for a listener,
the listener will accept MySQL-connections from clients, assign them to a
MaxScale service and route the queries from the client to backend servers. Any
backends used by the service should be MariaDB/MySQL-servers or compatible.

## `CDC`

See [Change Data Capture Protocol](../Protocols/CDC.md) for more information.

# TLS/SSL encryption

This section describes configuration parameters for both servers and listeners
that control the TLS/SSL encryption method and the various certificate files
involved in it.

To enable TLS/SSL for a listener, you must set the `ssl` parameter to
`true` and provide at least the `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key` parameters.

To enable TLS/SSL for a server, you must set the `ssl` parameter to
`true`. If the backend database server has certificate verification
enabled, the `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key` parameters must also be defined.

Custom CA certificates can be defined with the `ssl_ca_cert` parameter.

After this, MaxScale connections between the server and/or the client will be
encrypted. Note that the database must also be configured to use TLS/SSL
connections if backend connection encryption is used.

**Note:** MaxScale does not allow mixed use of TLS/SSL and normal connections on
  the same port.

If TLS encryption is enabled for a listener, any unencrypted connections to it
will be rejected. MaxScale does this to improve security by preventing
accidental creation of unencrypted connections.

The separation of secure and insecure connections differs from the MariaDB
server which allows both secure and insecure connections on the same port. As
MaxScale is the gateway through which all connections go, in order to guarantee
a more secure system MaxScale enforces a stricter security policy than what the
server does.

TLS encryption must be enabled for listeners when they are created. For servers,
the TLS can be enabled after creation but it cannot be disabled or altered.

### `ssl`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

This enables SSL connections when set to true. The legacy values `required` and
`disabled` were removed in MaxScale 6.0.

If enabled, the certificate files mentioned above must also be
supplied. MaxScale connections to will then be encrypted with TLS/SSL.

### `ssl_key`

A string giving a file path that identifies an existing readable file. The file
must be the SSL client private key MaxScale should use. This is a required
parameter for listeners but an optional parameter for servers.

### `ssl_cert`

A string giving a file path that identifies an existing readable file. The file
must be the SSL client certificate MaxScale should use with the server. The
certificate must match the key defined in `ssl_key`. This is a required
parameter for listeners but an optional parameter for servers.

### `ssl_ca_cert`

A string giving a file path that identifies an existing readable file. The file
must be the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate for the CA that signed the
certificate referred to in the previous parameter. It will be used to verify
that the certificate is valid. This is a required parameter for both listeners
and servers. The CA certificate can consist of a certificate chain.

### `ssl_version`

**Note:** It is highly recommended to leave this parameter to the default value
  of _MAX_. This will guarantee that the strongest available encryption is used.
  **Do not change this unless you know what you are doing**.

This parameter controls the level of encryption used. Accepted values are:

 * TLSv10
 * TLSv11
 * TLSv12
 * TLSv13
 * MAX

The default is to use the highest level of encryption available that both the
client and server support. MaxScale supports TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and
TLSv1.3 depending on the OpenSSL library version.

The `TLSv13` value was added in MaxScale 2.3.15 ([MXS-2762](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-2762)).

### `ssl_cipher`

Set the list of TLS ciphers. By default, no explicit ciphers are defined and the
system defaults are used. Note that this parameter does not modify TLSv1.3
ciphers.

### `ssl_cert_verify_depth`

The maximum length of the certificate authority chain that will be accepted. The
default value is 9, same as the OpenSSL default. The configured value must be
larger than 0.

### `ssl_verify_peer_certificate`

Peer certificate verification. This functionality is disabled by default. In
versions prior to 2.3.17 the feature was enabled by default.

When this feature is enabled, the peer must send a certificate. The certificate
sent by the peer is verified against the configured Certificate Authority to
make sure the peer is who they claim to be. For listeners, this behaves as if
`REQUIRE X509` was defined for all users. For servers, this behaves like the
`--ssl-verify-server-cert` command line option for the `mysql` client.

### `ssl_verify_peer_host`

- **Type**: [boolean](#booleans)
- **Default**: false
- **Dynamic**: Yes

Peer host verification.

When this feature is enabled, the peer hostname or IP is verified against the
certificate that is sent by the peer. If the IP address or the hostname does not
match the one in the certificate returned by the peer, the connection will be
closed. If the peer does not provide a certificate, the host verification is not
done. To require peer certificates, use `ssl_verify_peer_certificate`.

### `ssl_crl`

A string giving a file path that identifies an existing readable file. The file
must be a Certificate Revocation List in the PEM format that defines the revoked
certificates. This parameter is only accepted by listeners.

#### Example SSL enabled server configuration

```
[server1]
type=server
address=10.131.24.62
port=3306
ssl=true
ssl_cert=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/crt.max-client.pem
ssl_key=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/key.max-client.pem
ssl_ca_cert=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/crt.ca.maxscale.pem
```

This example configuration requires all connections to this server to be
encrypted with SSL. The paths to the certificate files and the Certificate
Authority file are also provided.

#### Example SSL enabled listener configuration

```
[RW-Split-Listener]
type=listener
service=RW-Split-Router
protocol=MariaDBClient
port=3306
ssl=true
ssl_cert=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/crt.maxscale.pem
ssl_key=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/key.csr.maxscale.pem
ssl_ca_cert=/usr/local/mariadb/maxscale/ssl/crt.ca.maxscale.pem
```

This example configuration requires all connections to be encrypted with
SSL. The paths to the certificate files and the Certificate Authority file are
also provided.

# Module Types

## Routing Modules

The main task of MariaDB MaxScale is to accept database connections from client
applications and route the connections or the statements sent over those
connections to the various services supported by MariaDB MaxScale.

Currently a number of routing modules are available, these are designed for a
range of different needs.

Connection based load balancing:
* [ReadConnRoute](../Routers/ReadConnRoute.md)

Read/Write aware statement based router:
* [ReadWriteSplit](../Routers/ReadWriteSplit.md)

Simple sharding on database level:
* [SchemaRouter](../Routers/SchemaRouter.md)

Binary log server:
* [Binlogrouter](../Routers/Binlogrouter.md)

## Monitor Modules

Monitor modules are used by MariaDB MaxScale to internally monitor the state of
the backend databases in order to set the server flags for each of those
servers. The router modules then use these flags to determine if the particular
server is a suitable destination for routing connections for particular query
classifications. The monitors are run within separate threads of MariaDB
MaxScale and do not affect MariaDB MaxScale's routing performance.

* [MariaDB Monitor](../Monitors/MariaDB-Monitor.md)
* [Galera Monitor](../Monitors/Galera-Monitor.md)

The use of monitors in MaxScale is not absolutely mandatory: it is possible to
run MariaDB MaxScale without a monitor module. In this case an external
monitoring system must the status of each server via MaxCtrl or the REST
API. **Only do this if you know what you are doing.**

## Filter Modules

![image alt text](images/image_10.png)

Filters provide a means to manipulate or process requests as they pass through
MariaDB MaxScale between the client side protocol and the query router. A full
explanation of each filter's functionality can be found in its documentation.

The [Filter Tutorial](../Tutorials/Filter-Tutorial.md) document shows how you
can add a filter to a service and combine multiple filters in one service.

* [Query Log All (QLA) Filter](../Filters/Query-Log-All-Filter.md)
* [Regular Expression Filter](../Filters/Regex-Filter.md)
* [Tee Filter](../Filters/Tee-Filter.md)
* [Top Filter](../Filters/Top-N-Filter.md)
* [Database Firewall Filter](../Filters/Database-Firewall-Filter.md)
* [Query Redirection Filter](../Filters/Named-Server-Filter.md)

# Encrypting Passwords

Passwords stored in the maxscale.cnf file may optionally be encrypted for added security.
This is done by creation of an encryption key on installation of MariaDB MaxScale.
Encryption keys may be created manually by executing the maxkeys utility with the argument
of the filename to store the key. The default location MariaDB MaxScale stores
the keys is `/var/lib/maxscale`. The passwords are encrypted using 256-bit AES CBC encryption.

```
 # Usage: maxkeys [PATH]
maxkeys /var/lib/maxscale/
```

Changing the encryption key for MariaDB MaxScale will invalidate any currently
encrypted keys stored in the maxscale.cnf file.

## Creating Encrypted Passwords

Encrypted passwords are created by executing the maxpasswd command with the location
of the .secrets file and the password you require to encrypt as an argument.

```
# Usage: maxpasswd PATH PASSWORD
maxpasswd /var/lib/maxscale/ MaxScalePw001
61DD955512C39A4A8BC4BB1E5F116705
```

The output of the maxpasswd command is a hexadecimal string, this should be inserted
into the maxscale.cnf file in place of the ordinary, plain text, password.
MariaDB MaxScale will determine this as an encrypted password and automatically decrypt
it before sending it the database server.

```
[Split-Service]
type=service
router=readwritesplit
servers=server1,server2,server3,server4
user=maxscale
password=61DD955512C39A4A8BC4BB1E5F116705
```

# Runtime Configuration Changes

Read the following documents for different methods of altering the MaxScale
configuration at runtime.

* MaxCtrl
  * [`create`](../Reference/MaxCtrl.md#create)
  * [`destroy`](../Reference/MaxCtrl.md#destroy)
  * [`add`](../Reference/MaxCtrl.md#add)
  * [`remove`](../Reference/MaxCtrl.md#remove)
  * [`alter`](../Reference/MaxCtrl.md#alter)

* [REST API](../REST-API/API.md) documentation

All changes to the configuration are persisted as individual configuration files
in `/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale.cnf.d/`. These files are applied after the main
configuration file and all auxiliary configurations have been loaded. This means
that once runtime configurations have been made, they need to be incorporated
into the main configuration files.

## Configuration Synchronization

The configuration synchronization mechanism is intended for synchronizing
configuration changes done on one MaxScale to all other MaxScales. This is done
by propagating the changes via the database cluster used by Maxscale.

When configuring configuration synchronization for the first time, the same
static configuration files should be used on all MaxScale instances that use the
same cluster: the value of `config_sync_cluster` must be the same on all
MaxScale instances and the cluster (i.e. the monitor) pointed by it and its
servers must be the same in every configuration.

Whenever the MaxScale configuration is modified at runtime, the latest
configuration is stored in the database cluster in the `mysql.maxscale_config`
table. A local copy of the configuration is stored in the data directory to
allow MaxScale to function even if a connection to the cluster cannot be
made. By default this file is stored at
`/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale-config.json`.

Whenever MaxScale starts up, it checks if a local version of this configuration
exists. If it does and it is a valid cached configuration, the static
configuration file as well as any other generated configuration files are
ignored. The exception is the `[maxscale]` section of the main static
configuration file which is always read.

Each configuration has a version number with the initial configuration being
version 0. Each time the configuration is modified, the version number is
incremented. This version number is used to detect when MaxScale needs to update
its configuration.

### Error Handling in Configuration Synchronization

When doing a configuration change on the local MaxScale, if the configuration
change completes on MaxScale but fails to be committed to the database, MaxScale
will attempt to revert the local configuration change. If this attempt fails,
MaxScale will discard the cached configuration and abort the process.

When synchronizing with the cluster, if MaxScale fails to apply a configuration
retrieved from the cluster, it attempts to revert the configuration to the
previous version. If successful, the failed configuration update is ignored. If
the configuration update that fails cannot be reverted, the MaxScale
configuration will be in an indeterminate state. When this happens, MaxScale
will discard the cached configuration and abort the process.

When loading a locally cached configuration during startup, if any errors are
found in the cached configuration, it is discarded and the MaxScale process will
attempt to restart by exiting with code 75 from the main process. If MaxScale is
being used as a SystemD service, this will automatically trigger a restart of
MaxScale and no further actions are needed.

The most common reason for a failed configuration update is missing files. For
example, if a configuration update adds encrypted connections to a server and
the TLS certificates it uses were not copied over to all MaxScale nodes before
the change was done, the operation will fail on all nodes that do not have these
files.

If the synchronization of the configuration change fails at the step when the
database transaction is being committed, the new configuration can be
momentarily visible to the local MaxScale. This means the changes are not
guaranteed to be atomic on the local MaxScale but are atomic from the cluster's
point of view.

### Managing Configuration Synchronization

The output of `maxctrl show maxscale` contains the `Config Sync` field with
information about the current configuration state of the local Maxscale as well
as the state of any other nodes using this cluster.

```
├──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Config Sync  │ {                                                           │
│              │     "checksum": "3dd6b467760d1d2023f2bc3871a60dd903a3341e", │
│              │     "nodes": {                                              │
│              │         "maxscale": "OK",                                   │
│              │         "maxscale2": "OK"                                   │
│              │     },                                                      │
│              │     "origin": "maxscale",                                   │
│              │     "status": "OK",                                         │
│              │     "version": 2                                            │
│              │ }                                                           │
├──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
```

The `version` field is the logical configuration version and the `origin` is the
node that originates the latest configuration change. The `checksum` field is
the checksum of the logical configuration and can be used to compare whether two
Maxscale instances are in the same configuration state. The `nodes` field
contains the status of each MaxScale instance mapped to the hostname of the
server. This field is updated whenever MaxScale reads the configuration from the
cluster and can thus be used to detect which MaxScales have updated their
configuration.

The `mysql.maxscale_config` table where the configuration changes are stored
must not be modified manually. The only case when the table should be modified
is when resetting the configuration synchronization.

To reset the configuration synchronization:

1. Stop all MaxScale instances
2. Remove the cached configuration file stored at
   `/var/lib/maxscale/maxscale-config.json` on all MaxScale instances
3. Drop the `mysql.maxscale_config` table
4. Start all MaxScale instances

To disable configuration synchronization, remove `config_sync_cluster` from the
configuration file or set it to an empty string: `config_sync_cluster=""`. This
can be done at runtime with MaxCtrl by passing an empty string to
`config_sync_cluster`:

```
maxctrl alter maxscale config_sync_cluster ""
```

If MaxScale cannot create a connection to the database cluster, configuration
changes are not possible until communication with the database is possible. To
override this behavior and force the changes to be done, use the `--skip-sync`
option for maxctrl or the `sync=false` HTTP parameter for the REST API. Any
updates done with `--skip-sync` will overwritten by changes coming from the
cluster.

### Limitations in Configuration Synchronization

* ([MXS-3619](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MXS-3619)) The synchronization
  only affects the MaxScale configuration. The state of objects or any external
  files (e.g. TLS certificates) are not synchronized by this mechanism.

## Backing Up Configuration Changes

The combination of configuration files can be done either manually
(e.g. `rsync`) or with the `maxscale --export-config=FILE` command line
option. See `maxscale --help` for more information about how to use the
`--export-config` flag.

For example, to export the current runtime configuration, run the following
command.

```
maxscale --export-config=/tmp/maxscale.cnf.combined
```

This will create the `/tmp/maxscale.cnf.combined` file and write the current
configuration into the it. This allows new MaxScale instances to be easily set
up without requiring copying of all runtime configuration files. The user
executing the command must be able to read all MaxScale configuration files as
well as create and write the provided filename.

# Error Reporting

MariaDB MaxScale is designed to be executed as a service, therefore all error
reports, including configuration errors, are written to the MariaDB MaxScale
error log file. By default, MariaDB MaxScale will log to a file in
`/var/log/maxscale` and the system log.

# Limitations

The current limitations of MaxScale are listed in the [Limitations](../About/Limitations.md) document.

# Troubleshooting

For a list of common problems and their solutions, read the
[MaxScale Troubleshooting](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/maxscale-troubleshooting/)
article on the MariaDB Knowledge Base.

## Systemd Watchdog

If MaxScale is running as a systemd service, the systemd Watchdog will be
enabled by default. To configure it, change the `WatchdogSec` option in the
Service section of the maxscale systemd configuration file located in
`/lib/systemd/system/maxscale.service`:

```
WatchdogSec=30s
```

It is not recommended to use a watchdog timeout less than 30 seconds. When
enabled MaxScale will check that all threads are running and notify systemd
with a "keep-alive ping".
