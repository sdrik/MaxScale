// These are TODOs for the GA version. The Beta version will not have persistence.
// 1. Read the file once at startup. There might also be a need to do cleanup
//    of the file if the configuration has changed.
// 2. Updates to the data should "quickly" become globally available,
//    rather than be written after every change.
// 3. Writing the file back should go through something like of lockless queue,
//    that triggers a write, possibly when there is less load on the system.
// 4. Every now and then some form of re-learn, maybe just dropping entries after
//    some expiration time.
// 5. If a host goes away (even for maintenance) entries associated with it should
//    probably be dropped immediately.
// 6. Save all data at shutdown.
// Start using xxhash
